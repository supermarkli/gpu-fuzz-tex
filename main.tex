\title{GPU-Fuzz: An Automated System for Fuzzing Deep Learning Frameworks on GPUs}

\author{NAME}


\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The extensive adoption of GPUs in deep learning (DL) frameworks has made their security and reliability paramount. However, existing fuzzing techniques often fail to penetrate deep into GPU compute kernels because they cannot efficiently generate the semantically valid, complex inputs that DL operators require. This paper introduces GPU-Fuzz, a fuzzing system that overcomes this challenge by leveraging the Z3 SMT solver. GPU-Fuzz automatically generates valid test cases by modeling the intricate parameter and shape relationships of DL operators as formal constraints. Applying this approach to major frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and PaddlePaddle, we discovered 14 unique, previously unknown bugs. Our system facilitates easy bug reproduction through a comprehensive logging mechanism that captures all necessary parameters and inputs. This work demonstrates that constraint-based fuzzing is a highly effective and practical approach for securing the core components of modern DL systems.

\title{\tool: Capturing Memory Corruption on NVIDIA GPUs}

\author{Anonymous Authors}


\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  Modern GPU applications, particularly in machine learning and scientific
  computing, are increasingly affected by memory corruption bugs due to their
  reliance on memory-unsafe languages like C/C++. However, existing solutions
  either depend on hardware/software that is not available on commodity GPUs,
  or incur prohibitive performance overheads, rendering them impractical for
  real-world deployment.

  We present \tool, a novel GPU sanitizer that is readily deployable on
  commodity NVIDIA GPUs. \tool employs a hybrid metadata scheme combining
  pointer tagging with in-band buffer bounds to enable accurate and efficient
  memory safety validation. \tool also introduces mechanisms such as stack epoch
  tracking and virtual address randomization to mitigate metadata confusion
  caused by temporal corruption.

  Our security evaluation on 33 programs demonstrates that \tool uniquely
  achieves comprehensive coverages of both spatial and temporal bugs among
  existing GPU sanitizers. Moreover, our performance benchmarks on 44 programs,
  including large-language models like LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B, show
  that \tool incurs an average slowdown of 13\% and a negligible
  memory overhead of 0.3\%.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}
This section details the implementation of the system design described in Section~\ref{sec:design}. Our system is developed in Python and comprises 2,628 lines of code.
    
We implemented a library where each operator is represented as a distinct class to realize the operator modeling and constraint-based test case generation concepts described in Section~\ref{sec:design}. This modeling approach was applied to 13 operators (\T~\ref{tab:operators}), chosen for their prevalence in deep learning models and their complex, error-prone memory access patterns.

The translation process (Section~\ref{sec:execution}) is implemented to translate the generated parameter values into framework-specific API calls. When compute-sanitizer~\cite{nvidia2023compsan} detects an error during execution, the system automatically archives the execution logs to ensure reproducibility.

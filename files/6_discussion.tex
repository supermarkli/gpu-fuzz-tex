While our results demonstrate the effectiveness of \textsc{GPU-Fuzz}, we acknowledge several limitations and areas for future work.

\parh{Manual Modeling Effort.} 
The quality of \textsc{GPU-Fuzz} depends on its constraint library. Our current library supports 13 operators, but this is a subset of the hundreds of operators available. Extending coverage requires manual effort to model constraints (100-150 LoC per family). Future work could explore semi-automating constraint extraction from framework documentation to improve scalability.

\parh{Limited Oracle.} 
Our primary oracle, compute-sanitizer, excels at finding memory errors but cannot detect silent numerical correctness issues or performance regressions. Differential fuzzing against a trusted CPU implementation is a promising direction for a more comprehensive oracle.
